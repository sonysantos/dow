# dow: DApp Over WebRTC

## Overview

The idea is to use WebRTC to share sites and data to build a highly-decentralized and free internet by automatically and transparently using *all* connected devices as nodes.

### Dapps

DApps (Decentralized Applications) are the future of internet. Central servers can suffer several kinds of attacks, natural and governmental interventions, data transfer issues etc. If sites can be spread along several servers around the globe, they can be highly available and faster.

### Blockchains and other DLTs

The coming of programmable blockchains, like Ethereum and others, opened a huge market for dapps. Several blockchain alternatives has been developed, like holochain, hashgraph, dag, tangle etc. They are referred to as [Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-vs-hashgraph-vs-dag-vs-holochain/).

However, DLTs have some drawbacks:
* Programming DLTs is not straightforward; developers must learn new languages and paradigmas.
* It's necessary to create and maintain digital wallets to serve and to use dapps. Managing wallets is not easy for most users (it's not as simple as typing username and password).
* It's necessary to pay some value in cryptocurrency tokens to use dapps. This requirement turns difficult to build free services for users. Most users won't buy cryptocurrencies.
* Some DLTs require users to download and install software in order to use them, which is hard for non-technical users.

### Zeronet

[Zeronet](https://zeronet.io) is an interesting alternative to DLTs, since it has some advantages:
* It's free: users share their storage and bandwidth to serve pages.
* No need of wallets.
* No need of buying cryptoassets (except for namecoin if the developer wants to register a prettier domain name).
* It uses well-known languages like Javascript and MySQL.
* Auto-login for zeronet sites.
* It's very easy to be a node.

The downsides of Zeronet are:
* User still must download and install Zeronet software in order to use it, and it's not available for all common platforms/OS.
* For proxies and multiuser sites, it's needed to insert the private key as login, but it's not well documented how to get the own private key.

### WebRTC

TODO

### Requeriments for dow

* The use must be free, because users already pay for their devices, storage and internet.
* zero installation
* automatic use in all devices
