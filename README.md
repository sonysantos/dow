# dow: DApp Over WebRTC

## Overview

The idea is to use WebRTC to share sites and data to build a highly-decentralized and free internet by automatically and transparently using *all* connected devices as nodes.

## Rationale, Motivations and Inspirations

DApps (Decentralized Applications) are the future of internet. Central servers can suffer several kinds of attacks, natural and governmental interventions, data transfer issues etc. If sites can be spread along several servers around the globe, they can be highly available and faster.

The coming of programmable blockchains, like Ethereum and others, opened a huge market for dapps. Several blockchain alternatives has been developed, like holochain, hashgraph, dag, tangle etc. They are referred to as [Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)](https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-vs-hashgraph-vs-dag-vs-holochain/). However, programming DLTs is not straightforward, and it's necessary to create wallets and pay some value in cryptocurrency tokens to serve and/or to use dapps. To learn to create and use wallets is not straightforward either for most users.

### To speak about

* The use must be free, because users already pay for their devices, storage and internet.
* zero installation
* automatic use in all devices
